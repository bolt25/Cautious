<h1> Hack Infinity 2.0  </h1>
<h3> Cautious </h3>


This app was designed to make you, not only feel safe but also assists any dangerous situation, could help minimize any catastrophic event to take place by not only letting the near police patrol know about the status of distress but also shares the safest route which should be followed but at the same time it also shares the longitude and latitude.

<h3> Motivation </h3>

Looking at the current world scenario we wanted to make an impact which would be not only reduce the safety issue cases at National level but also the global level.We were really disgust by the current cases in India like Unnao or nirbhaya.It feels really terible to be living in that kind of society so rather than putting blame on others and empathizing victims for no reasons. We want to prune each every case so there is no future victim.
